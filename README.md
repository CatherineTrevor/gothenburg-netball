# Project Overview
This project is my Milestone Project One as part of the Full Stack Software Diploma Course with the Code Institute.

I am on the committee for the Gothenburg Netball Club: a team of amateur netball players, set up for English-speaking adults in Gothenburg. Sadly due to the current Covid-19 situation having such a negative impact on sports, we have been unable to have routine sessions, and therefore do not have a group of regular players.

I am taking this opportunity to create a simple, clearly structured website to promote the club, so that when we can start playing again in the spring, there is a larger awareness and interest in the club, encouring site visitors to join a session, and become paying members. It will also serve as a place that regular players can see upcoming training dates, times and locations. 

The club's current online presence is via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gothenburgnetball/).
# User Experience Design (UXD)
## Strategy
The site has been designed using a mobile-first approach to ensure ease of obtaining information.

It is imperative that the look and feel of the site be friendly, feel local, and approachable: the objective is that people feel comfortable contacting the club and want to join us to play, even if just once. If the site feels too commercial, busy, or cold it will not provide this positive feeling to the user.

### Target audience
English-speaking adults (whether native or not), aged 18 or over, who wish to meet other people, whilst playing an amateur sport. Site users are based in Gothenburg, Sweden, or can travel to the city on a regular basis.

Users can have experience of netball, perhaps having played in school or college, or no experience at all. This is not a competitive environment: it is meant to be fun, therefore level of playing experience, or even knowlegde of the game is immaterial. All are welcome and the site must reflect this.

Where users have knowledge of the game and / or are interested in volunteering, we invite them to join the committee and / or provide help in umpiring / coaching.

Once play resumes, the website is live and more people start playing there will be many opportunities to build on the website and expand it to meet the growing and changing needs of the club.

**Feature 1:** An online membership form with e-signature capability.
This feature has not been implemented in the first release as I do not yet have the knowledge to do so.

**Features 2:** Online payment methods for membership and sessions fees.
This feature has not been implemented in the first release as the club doesn't have a bank account and I do not yet have the knowledge to build this option into the site.

**Feature 3:** Sponsorship opportunities.
This feature has not been implemented in the first release as the club doesn't have the necessary presence yet to create interest from potential sponsors.

## Structure

The website is structured into four pages: Home | What is netball? | Get in touch | Photo gallery.

Each page is responsive on various device sizes, has the same clean, simple structure and contain the navigation bar and footer. The navigation bar is static, and the favicon links back to the home page.

## Surface
### Typography:
### Imagery:
### Color scheme:
The principle colors selected are variants of blue and yellow, the reason being two-fold: they are the colors of the Swedish flag, and other netball clubs in Sweden have red and green as their team colors. Other colors have been selected using [Coolors](www.coolors.com) to compliment the main colors, and provide a feeling of safety and calm, as required in the strategy.
